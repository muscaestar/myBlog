I'm a newbie who bumped into the programming world a few years ago and decided to
stay forever. Now I'm studying IT in University. This blog shall witness my passion
and efforts.

I love Vim and Doom-Emacs. But since I realized these endless tool-customizing time didn't actually
benefit my core skills, I've started to focus on 'decent real-matters'.

Start from, data structures and algorithms...
